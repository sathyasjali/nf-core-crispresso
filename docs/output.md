# nf-core/crispresso: Output

## Introduction

This document describes the output produced by the pipeline. Most of the plots are taken from the MultiQC report, which summarises results at the end of the pipeline.

The directories listed below will be created in the results directory after the pipeline has finished. All paths are relative to the top-level results directory.

<!-- TODO nf-core: Write this documentation describing your workflow's output -->

## Pipeline overview

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) and processes data using the following steps:

- [FastQC](#fastqc) - Raw read QC
- [CRISPResso2](#crispresso2) - CRISPR editing analysis
- [Results Summary](#results-summary) - CSV files with quantitative analysis
- [MultiQC](#multiqc) - Aggregate report describing results and QC from the whole pipeline
- [Pipeline information](#pipeline-information) - Report metrics generated during the workflow execution

### FastQC

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `fastqc/`
  - `*_fastqc.html`: FastQC report containing quality metrics.
  - `*_fastqc.zip`: Zip archive containing the FastQC report, tab-delimited data file and plot images.

</details>

[FastQC](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) gives general quality metrics about your sequenced reads. It provides information about the quality score distribution across your reads, per base sequence content (%A/T/G/C), adapter contamination and overrepresented sequences. For further reading and documentation see the [FastQC help pages](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/Help/).

### CRISPResso2

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `crispresso2/`
  - `CRISPResso_on_*/*.html`: Interactive HTML report with detailed analysis
  - `CRISPResso_on_*/CRISPResso_quantification_of_editing_frequency.txt`: Editing efficiency summary
  - `CRISPResso_on_*/Modification_count_vectors.txt`: Position-specific modification counts
  - `CRISPResso_on_*/Indel_histogram.txt`: Distribution of insertion/deletion sizes
  - `CRISPResso_on_*/Effect_vector_combined.txt`: Combined effect scoring per position

</details>

[CRISPResso2](https://crispresso.pinellolab.partners.org/) provides comprehensive analysis of CRISPR editing outcomes. It quantifies editing efficiency, identifies the most frequent modifications, and provides detailed statistics on insertions, deletions, and substitutions at each position in the amplicon.

### Results Summary

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `results_summary/`
  - `*_summary.csv`: Key metrics summary per sample
  - `*_detailed_results.csv`: Position-specific modification data

</details>

The results summary module creates machine-readable CSV files for downstream analysis:

**Summary CSV** contains:
- **Sample identification**: Sample ID and amplicon information
- **Read statistics**: Total read count, mapped read count, mapping percentages  
- **Reference mapping**: Number of reads mapped to reference sequence
- **Indel analysis**: Total indels, insertion/deletion counts, most frequent indel sizes
- **Editing efficiency**: Overall modification rates and editing percentages
- **Quality metrics**: FastQC statistics (total sequences, GC content, read length)
- **Amplicon details**: Guide RNA and amplicon sequence information

**Detailed CSV** contains:
- Position-by-position modification frequencies (insertions, deletions, substitutions)
- Read depth information per amplicon position
- Statistical data ready for downstream analysis and custom plotting

These CSV files enable easy integration with statistical software (R, Python) and spreadsheet applications for further analysis and visualization.

### MultiQC

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `multiqc/`
  - `multiqc_report.html`: a standalone HTML file that can be viewed in your web browser.
  - `multiqc_data/`: directory containing parsed statistics from the different tools used in the pipeline.
  - `multiqc_plots/`: directory containing static images from the report in various formats.

</details>

[MultiQC](http://multiqc.info) is a visualization tool that generates a single HTML report summarising all samples in your project. Most of the pipeline QC results are visualised in the report and further statistics are available in the report data directory.

Results generated by MultiQC collate pipeline QC from supported tools e.g. FastQC. The pipeline has special steps which also allow the software versions to be reported in the MultiQC output for future traceability. For more information about how to use MultiQC reports, see <http://multiqc.info>.

### Pipeline information

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `pipeline_info/`
  - Reports generated by Nextflow: `execution_report.html`, `execution_timeline.html`, `execution_trace.txt` and `pipeline_dag.dot`/`pipeline_dag.svg`.
  - Reports generated by the pipeline: `pipeline_report.html`, `pipeline_report.txt` and `software_versions.yml`. The `pipeline_report*` files will only be present if the `--email` / `--email_on_fail` parameter's are used when running the pipeline.
  - Reformatted samplesheet files used as input to the pipeline: `samplesheet.valid.csv`.
  - Parameters used by the pipeline run: `params.json`.

</details>

[Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/tracing.html) provides excellent functionality for generating various reports relevant to the running and execution of the pipeline. This will allow you to troubleshoot errors with the running of the pipeline, and also provide you with other information such as launch commands, run times and resource usage.
